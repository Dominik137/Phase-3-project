Welcome to Subscription Saver!

Subscription Saver uses Python and SQL Alchemy to dilever a User friendly Command Line Interface where users can create their own account and add, edit or delete and of their subscriptions. It allows users to keep track of important information about their subscriptions! 

I built this Subscription tracker to display my ability to work with Python classes, SQL, and making tables for relational data!
